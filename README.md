# Build and Deploy a Security Threat Detection System using Amazon SageMaker

### Overview of Project ☁️
This project involves building and deploying a Cybersecurity Threat Detection System using Amazon SageMaker. The system identifies anomalous network activity that may indicate cyberattacks, such as DDoS attacks, unauthorized access, or phishing attempts. The machine learning pipeline automates data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, deployment, and inference.

### Key components:
* Data Ingestion & Preprocessing: Raw network traffic logs are collected, transformed, and feature-engineered to create a structured dataset.
* Model Training & Evaluation: An XGBoost model is trained to classify network activity as normal or malicious.
* Deployment & Inference: The trained model is deployed as an endpoint to detect real-time security threats.
* Pipeline Automation: An end-to-end SageMaker Pipeline automates data transformation, model training, and deployment.
